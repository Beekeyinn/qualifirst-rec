They are from the same species of trees and are often used in place of hazelnuts as they are very difficult to tell apart. Can be used as a raw snack or in baking. After one crunch you\u2019ll be hooked and realize Whole Raw Filberts as the best form of hazelnut! RAW SHELLED FILBERTS \u2013 Shelled Filberts are not only tasty but also quite nutritious. They\u2019re rich in unsaturated fats, high in magnesium, calcium USAGE IDEAS \u2013 They are roasted and used as filler in mixed nuts, to produce nut liqueurs, and the sweet syrup flavourings used in hot beverages. Whole Raw Filberts can also be used in cookies such as chocolate biscotti or for making brittle. STORAGE \u2013 Shelled Whole Raw Filberts have a long shelf life and can be stored in the pantry for up to three months. If you choose to keep them in the fridge, they can last for up to six months.

Well, for one, it's \"ancient\". Whole grain farro is delicious and think rustic Italian food. Chefs prize it for its nutty flavour, delicate chew, and versatility. However, the word \"better\" to describe farro is subjective, but, it's fair to say that it makes a great gateway grain.

STEP UP YOUR GRAINS \u2013 Expand the variety of grains you eat by trying this widely forgotten ancient food, which has been nicknamed \u201cPharaoh\u2019s wheat\u201d due to its egyptian origins before it came to Italy. Not only is farro making a comeback for its great taste, it\u2019s also more nutrient packed than most other grains. PREMIUM QUALITY \u2013 Epigrain is dedicated to supplying only the best quality ingredients, and their passion for  grains and legumes is evident in the wholesome flavour and texture of all of their products. This farro only has 1 ingredient: farro. You can be sure that nothing else has been added and that you have the purest, highest quality product possible. A  CHOICE \u2013 Farro grains are extremely high in fibre, iron, zinc, magnesium, vitamin B and protein. It\u2019s also sure to fill you up , since it\u2019s an unprocessed grain; this means it has an intact bran and germ, the parts of the grain that provide nutrients, protein and fiber, which winds up swelling up in your digestive tract, keeping you satisfied for longer than refined grains. As an unprocessed grain, it is also high in antioxidants. HIGH VERSATILITY \u2013 Farro grain is extremely versatile and can be utilized in myriad recipes. For instance, you can add it in any pureed vegetable soup, stir-fry it with eggs and veggies, toss it in salad, serve it as a hot breakfast cereal with fresh berries and ricotta cheese\u2026 the possibilities are almost endless. ALTERNATIVE DIET COMPATIBILITY \u2013 Farro grain is pure food that is 100% vegan and vegetarian friendly, and its high level of nutrients make it all the more suited for a balanced diet of that sort. And while farro grain does contain gluten, it contains lower levels than today\u2019s wheat, and if prepared properly, the gluten is pre-digested and broken down by sprouting and fermentation like a sourdough process.

THANKSGIVING \u2013 If you are questioning if you should brine your turkey this Thanksgiving, the answer is always YES! Turkey Brining Spice makes a world of a difference and is worth the time to allow the turkey to absorb extra moisture and salt to break down some of the turkeys proteins making it more tender. Not only will you be delighted but your guests will be extremely satisfied. THE PROCESS \u2013 Are you tired of plain old dry turkey? If properly brined it will stay juicy even if you overshoot the cooking a little! Only brine turkeys that have NOT been pre-salted. Once out of the brine, pat dry and rub with your desired spices (although you can skip the salt), and cook! BRINING \u2013 To get the most out of the Turkey Brining Spice it is best to let it marinade. Place the turkey in the fridge with the Turkey Brining Spice mixed with warm water for a minimum of 12 hours completely submerged. For crispier skin, let it dry for another 24 hours in the fridge before cooking. Keeping the turkey juicy and delicious isn\u2019t that hard after all, just remember to check the turkey early! IMPROVED DINING \u2013 Marinating your Turkey in Turkey Brining Spice is only going to improve your holiday dinner. Turkey Brining Spice will season the turkey all the way through, resulting in craveworthy flavour. You will find the bird to be plump and locked with moisture for a tender, juicy, and delicious meal.

The cherry (St. Lucie or Mahaleb) stones are dried and cracked, and the seed (kernel) is extracted. The seed is chewy and soft and is ground into a powder. The flavour is like a mix of cherry and bitter almond \u2013 almost like a marzipan taste. Some say that they notice slight hints of floral and vanilla. Once the powder is cooked into the recipe, it becomes rich, fruity and subtle. It can be used in smaller amounts to enhance the flavour of traditional treats and sweets such as donuts, pastries, pies, breads, spreads, cakes, buns, biscuits, and various other desserts. Mahleb spice is a popular ingredient that has been used for centuries in Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cuisine. It pairs well with dairy and honey and is a great spice to experiment with when creating delicious baked goods. This product originated in Turkey, is produced by 24K and comes in 50 gram container. Remember, a little goes a long way when it comes to Mahleb so use it sparingly. vendor: 24K. Product price: 100.08 CAD. category: Spices, Seasonings & Sauces , Spices & Herbs , Spices (Whole, Ground). created in: Turkey. BITTER SWEET - This spice has a strong flavour that is similar to bitter almonds and wild cherries. It is bold, tart and definitely leaves an impression on you. Some say it is very close to the taste of marzipan. Some report slight tones of vanilla and floral. USAGE IDEAS - Use this powder in smaller amounts to enhance the flavour of traditional treats, desserts and sweets such as donuts, pastries, pies, breads, spreads, cakes, buns and biscuits. You can enhance the flavour of many desserts by adding just a little of this tasty somewhat exotic powder. A LEGENDARY SPICE - Mahleb spice has its own history trail and is a very popular ingredient that has been used for centuries in Mediterranean and Middle Eastern recipes. You'll find it in tsoureki breads in Greece, ma'amoul scones in the Middle East and po\u011fa\u00e7a scones in Turkey. VERSATILE - Mahleb can be used in numerous ways. It can be made into a paste with honey, sesame seeds and nuts and eaten as a snack with bread or a dessert. It can be added to all sorts of baked goods, from bundt cakes, muffins and sugar cookies to crumb cakes, scones and donuts. PAIRS WELL - It pairs well with dairy, whether cheese or milk form. It can also blend extremely well with honey - so much that you might not be able to stop eating it! It works well in a rice pudding, cr\u00e8me brulee and cheese-based tart recipes.

Product price: 757.9 CAD. category: Chocolates & Desserts , Chocolate Couverture & Coating , Cacao Ingredients. created in: France. VEGAN-FRIENDLY \u2014 Although it\u2019s called a butter, cacao butter is a vegetable fat. With no dairy products added, it is suitable for vegans. COOKING PROPERTIES \u2014 A little goes a long way. You don\u2019t need to use as much cacao butter as normal butter or oil when cooking. It doesn\u2019t burn easily either as it has a high smoke point so you can use it when you want to cook at a high temperature. SAVOURY DISHES \u2014 Cacao butter is ideal for searing meat. Due to its resistance to high temperatures, you can cook meat with this butter and look forward to tender meat with a rich colouring. Melt the cacao butter and toss it with vegetables before roasting them in the oven to enjoy caramelized vegetables with your meal. DESSERTS \u2014 Use cacao butter as a replacement for regular butter or margarine when making buttercream for cakes or in your recipes for a chocolate fondant dessert, cookies or brownies. BENEFITS \u2014 Cacao butter contains nutritious fats, which help to fill you up, enhance your mood and stimulate your brain. It also has anti-inflammatory properties and contains antioxidants to help improve your heart and boost your immune system.

HOW IT\u2019S MADE \u2013 Locust bean gum is a vegetable gum extracted from the seeds of the carob tree, native to the Mediterranean. The seeds are inside of pods that grow on the tree, which are kibbled to separate the seeds. Acid treatment removes the skin off the seeds. The skinless seeds are subsequently split and crushed. This allows the germ and endosperm to separate via sieving. Once separate, the endosperm is milled again, this time by a roller which produces the final locust bean gum powder. HOW TO USE \u2013 Locust bean gum requires synergy with another ingredient to be functional; agar, kappa carrageenan, methyl cellulose, konjac or xanthan gum. Xanthan gum is used to create elastic gels, agar or kappa carrageenan to give strength and elasticity, and guar gum to create a thicker gel.
