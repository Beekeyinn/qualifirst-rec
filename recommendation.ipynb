EXTERNAL USES – To use grapeseed oil on your face, massage several drops into clean skin before you go to bed at night. Since grapeseed oil doesn't clog pores, it's ideal for all skin types, including oily skin that needs moisturizing. It is lightweight and doesn't leave a greasy or weighed down effect on hair. When applied to your hair, grapeseed oil adds moisture, strength, and shine. Ingredients: 100% refined grape seed oil. Substance: Liquid Oil. Additive free. Gluten free. Vegan. Keto friendly.

Turkey Brining Spice makes a world of a difference and is worth the time to allow the turkey to absorb extra moisture and salt to break down some of the turkeys proteins making it more tender. Not only will you be delighted but your guests will be extremely satisfied. THE PROCESS \\\\u2013 Are you tired of plain old dry turkey? If properly brined it will stay juicy even if you overshoot the cooking a little! Only brine turkeys that have NOT been pre-salted. Once out of the brine, pat dry and rub with your desired spices (although you can skip the salt), and cook! BRINING \\\\u2013 To get the most out of the Turkey Brining Spice it is best to let it marinade. Place the turkey in the fridge with the Turkey Brining Spice mixed with warm water for a minimum of 12 hours completely submerged. For crispier skin, let it dry for another 24 hours in the fridge before cooking. Keeping the turkey juicy and delicious isn\\\\u2019t that hard after all, just remember to check the turkey early! IMPROVED DINING \\\\u2013 Marinating your Turkey in Turkey Brining Spice is only going to improve your holiday dinner. Turkey Brining Spice will season the turkey all the way through, resulting in craveworthy flavour. You will find the bird to be plump and locked with moisture for a tender, juicy, and delicious meal.
